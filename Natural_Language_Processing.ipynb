(it was highly recommended by our waitress by the way!) i didn't think any of the drinks were that great as i sipped my friend's drinks. \\\\n\\\\nthe meal included the following: (keep in mind 9 girls!!!)\\\\n1. 3 tiny portions of guac and chips. guac was ok but i've had better and i felt like the chips were a little stale. \\\\n2. 2 plates of caesar salad. i mean you can't really go wrong with caesar salad but i don't think the lettuce was very fresh. \\\\n3. 2 plates of steak and potatoes. the portion on each plate was enough to probably feed 1 person so imagine 4 to 5 girls sharing the portion for 1 person. i mean yes it's vegas and we want to look good in our dresses but we also want to eat so we don't get wasted. yes, the steak was good - the whole 4 bites that i ate! it's literally 1 slice per person as it's 5 pieces pre-cut.\\\\n\\\\ni'm sure this meal would have been better if we actually paid to dine at beso but to be honest promoters should just tell people that it's a comp taste sampling and to come eaten! i was on my phone yelping the nearest fast food restaurant for us to eat more but this comp meal only takes reservations 9/9:30/10 (they just want you to go to eve club even if you don't want to) so it doesn't really allow time to eat meal #2 before trying to get into a club the promoter promised to walk you right in but goes mia. i definitely would have rather paid to eat elsewhere and i will probably never step foot into beso again. \\\\n\\\\nyou win this time but i hope i win in the long run with this yelp review.\",\n",

              " 'first of all, i decided to have a massage on my last day of a hectic business trip because hubby raved about the best 25-minute massage he had ever had here at the spa at aria. unfortunately, the masseuse he had was not working the day i went in and mine, although professional enough, did not listen to my requests (a common theme at this resort) to focus on my back and shoulders and to increase the pressure. this just left me more frustrated and knotted up than beforehand.\\\\n\\\\ngetting to the spa is a bit confusing; the lack of signs is also a common theme at this resort. stepping out of the \\\\\"\"spa\\\\\"\" elevator, you find yourself in a relatively dark hall, with the women\\'s side on the left and the men\\'s on the right. the doors have no handle; you wave your hand in front of a sensor -- that is, if you can read the tiny little instructions in the dark. once inside the spa itself, i also spent time walking around in circles looking for certain areas. the funny thing is the large green, un-spa-like exit signs are everywhere, but you have to figure out where everything is on your own. there is a relaxation room in the women\\'s side (i\\'m not sure about the men\\'s side), but you have to go out and into the co-ed waiting room to get picked up for your service. this waiting room was filled with uncomfortable square couches which did not allow for any relaxing position whatsoever. it was also open to traffic on three sides, so you could see and hear people walking around and talking or pushing carts of towels around. very non-relaxing.\\\\n\\\\nthe women-only relaxation room was also the same room that you walk into from the elevator, and the noise and conversation of people checking in or out did not belong here.\\\\n\\\\ntwo special rooms, the salt room and the one with the heated stone beds, are accessed just outside of the co-ed waiting room. again, signs are practically non-existent. these rooms were unique, and i would have enjoyed them more if each bed or recliner were more private. the co-ed pool had a partially nice view of some distant mountains framed by buildings and a large neon sign of the elvis show. it is basically an extra-large, rectangular jacuzzi; supposedly 33 persons max can fit in it, but just 4 of us was making me wanting more space already.\\\\n\\\\nthe standard spa facilities included a nice steam room, sauna, cold plunge pool and jacuzzis for women- and men-only, and fruit, water and tea. the robes were all osfm (one size fits most) but much too large for me. when i asked where the swimsuit dryer was, the first attendant didn\\'t know, and another one said it hadn\\'t been hooked up yet. in the shower, the hot and cold are reversed. another design flaw of this spa is the toilet area is separated by a door to the rest of the spa facilities, but there are no sinks to wash your hands in before touching this communal door. hubby confirmed this was the same in the men\\'s side. something was broken the day i was there, and the women\\'s section smelled awful.\\\\n\\\\ni have no desire to return to this particular spa, except to try a massage from the therapist who worked on my husband (one extra star for her). aria\\'s spa simply did not have an appropriate design or zen-like atmosphere.',\n",

(ok, i guess that is not that big of a deal)\\\\n-you must order a soda (annoying...but whatever)\\\\n-you can\\'t leave the restaurant with them. she literally told him \\\\\"\"if you don\\'t eat all your wings, we are going to throw them away. you can\\'t take them with you.\\\\\"\" (extremely annoying, petty, and wasteful)\\\\nok fine. i will get the wings and stick to your stupid rules. and then this happened:\\\\n\\\\nwaitress \\\\\"\"ranch or blue cheese?\\\\\"\"\\\\nhusband \\\\\"\"can i try one of each?\\\\\"\"\\\\nwaitress \\\\\"\" well, you can only have one per order....i mean i guess i can do that for you, but i have to charge you extra for it\\\\\"\"\\\\n\\\\nseriously? i tried to stifle my laughter, but the entire wing conversation had been so obnoxious, it was laughable. it would be one thing if she was nice and was just trying to follow the rules, she was pretty rude. \\\\n\\\\nok so my husband gets his order of wings in, after agreeing to the \\\\\"\"wing laws\\\\\"\". i ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. safe choice. not. my meal came with soup. meh. nothing great. the food comes, the wings are decent. i laughed again when i saw the spaghetti. i am not exaggerating when i say that it was noodles, on top of tomato soup with microwaved meatballs on top. yum! my husband looked at my plate with a \\\\\"\"wtf\\\\\"\" face. we took a picture of it because of what an amazing failure it was. my husband said \\\\\"\"the only time i have seen spaghetti like that is when i try to make it at home.\\\\\"\" \\\\n i\\'m pretty sure the waitress knew that it looked nasty. it was a drop and run. we didn\\'t see her again for 20 minutes. i eventually flagged her down and sent the food back. my husband asked if i would like to share some wings with him. we order another small order of wings. they were again, just ok. i ordered the raspberry chipotle wings, they tasted like bottled bbq sauce. nothing amazing. when we finished our food, we waited another 15 minutes for someone to notice us. 3, yes 3 waiters walked right by us. it was obvious that we were done. their were napkins on both plates and we were just sitting there. one waiter walked by twice. and we still sat there. finally our waitress came back took a couple dishes and disappeared again. they must have a freaking amazing break room or something. the best part was when i turned around to see if any employees could come rescue us, and a big group of wait staff are standing in one little spot watching the game. mmmk. cool. we\\'ll just wait til you are done there. \\\\n\\\\n so lets review, bad service, awful food, bad location, wing laws. no thanks. it would be one thing if you had amazing wings, but the wings are just average. they are neither here nor there. i would rather go to native new yorker\\'s for wing night. they don\\'t care how many ranches you want. haha\\\\n\\\\nedit:\\\\nafter this was posted, i received a viscous, profanity filled response from a stranger who was apparently hugely insulted that i didn\\'t like a trashy restaurant that he considers a 5 star establishment. so i share my bad experience on a website that was created to keep others in the know and i get attacked with insults and derogatory comments? so guess what pullano\\'s, i just dropped a star on my review. you are disgusting and so are your loyal patrons.',\n",

rock the casbah!\\\\\"\" however this version of the kasbah is made with ground lamb and it comes stuffed with chopped dates, pistachios, smoked gouda and topped with moroccan aioli [eye-oh-lee] sauce (sounds intriguing right). as a side dish i was able to choose from: pub fries, caesar or pub salad or the homemade soup of the day which was chipotle bean soup. i of course opted for the fries, because i love fries and they make me want to break out in a ballad. like: i love the fries, the fries love me, they taste so good, so yummy yummy yummy... now get in my belly.\\\\n\\\\nit took quite a while for our order to arrive, but at first sight i thought it was covered with what appeared to be a spicy yellow mustard substance and instantly i asked the waiter with a perplexed look on my face, \\\\\"\"what is this yellow stuff\\\\\"\". \\\\\"\"moroccan aioli sauce\\\\\"\", he simply explained. at this point i was a little beyond buzzing (empty stomach) and thought to myself oh yeah that\\'s right i did read that somewhere. so i proceeded as always and piled on the red onions, lettuce, the single slice of tomato and finished off with the bun. the first bite made me think of indian or burmese curry. it was like i was eating a curry burger. seriously a curry burger. i am fan of curry so to me this was good, but there was something missing. i cannot put my finger on it. perhaps a spice or ingredient but something was off. needless to say this is one of those items that won\\'t be a hit with everyone. i did enjoy it and the fries though were awesome, crispy and full of flavor. \\\\n\\\\ni liked the burger, the concept, the use of lamb, but something was missing from the moroccan aioli sauce. anyhow i did dig the curry like flavor and experience of the burger. would order it again!',\n",

(the $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.) everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene. others are taking notice, too. michelle laudig (former restaurant critic at phoenix new times) and aaron chamberlin of st. francis both dropped in during our dinner.\\\\n\\\\ni worry about the az heat baking the charm out of patio dining in may, \\\\njune, and july for chef curry, but i hope to return in april...maybe on a tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.\\\\n\\\\nother reviews of payton curry's chef-in-residence at welcome diner: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix\",\n",

we all replied \\\\\"\"yes!\\\\\"\" and finally started enjoying ourselves by swallowing each piece while the butler was placing it on the table. not by any means does this mean that we got what we paid for but at least we had 5 minutes of enjoyment and wished the whole experience was like that. this was also the first time i saw smiles on my kids\\' faces (aged 8 and 12).\\\\n\\\\nwe were prepared to spend around $1000 and the bill was little below $900, so no problem there. although the fact that our kids were charged $7 for each of the sprite refills ($28 for four) should be noted.\\\\n\\\\nfinally, we were given a bag with small box of dessert pieces and two beautiful certificates of attendance with our names on them and the list of all 16 courses we were supposed to enjoy. we were also given a nice color brochure with pictures of each those items. all this looks pretty, but at the same time embarrassing - like being given a certificate of investing with madoff. you could show it off only until everyone else figures out that madoff was a crook.\\\\n\\\\nin the end we will remember this place as one of the worst experiences of our lives and we would not go there again even if the food was free. giving one star to this place is way too generous, while two stars would be just insane.',\n",
