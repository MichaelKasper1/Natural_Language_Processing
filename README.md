# Natural_Language_Processing
In this Repository, I explore natural language processing techniques. Specifically, I use a variety of vector and transformer embedding techniques and NLP models for text classification.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a large subfield of machine learning. NLP allows data to be extracted from text. This can be implemented to perform tasks such as creating translators, performing sentiment analysis to understand product reviews on large scale, or help guide medical diagnostics.

In this project, I will be performing sentiment analysis on data from tensorflow's downloadable data sets. Specifically, I will be using Tensorflow's yelp_polarity_review dataset. I will be talking about sentiment analysis in this notebook, but these models could also be used to extract other kinds of important text data.

If I had more time and unlimited computing power, I would try many models and tune parameters for each. Ideally, I would keep embedding and modeling methods consistent so I could compare accuracy of my models only changing one variable at a time. This project is more about personal learning than anything else so I did not worry about that.

#Data
The data for this project is from Tensorflow's datasets and are loaded in within the colaboratory notebook!
